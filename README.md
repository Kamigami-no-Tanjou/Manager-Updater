# Manager-Updater
A small rest API service that is meant to be the only entry point to edit the data to be displayed in the KnT Manager.

> **NOTE :**
> This service is still supported. It doesn't need any update right now, which explains why it doesn't look active, but this repository will remain supported as long as this github organisation is active!
